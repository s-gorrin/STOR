This is an application to inventory and work with clothing.

Clothing is stored in a "closet" and consists of a clothing type,
along with a set of attributes. The program maintains a compatibility table
which is used to suggest outfits, based on what clothing items can go with others,
mostly by type and color.

Execution begins at the Main class.
